## Challenges
This module was particularly challenging in terms of how to use loops and collect data from Data Frames. Though we were taught most of what we needed to know during the module, the challenge had certain aspects that needed additional research. 
I didnt know that Open Weather had a maximum of request per minute. At a certain point I was making too many request and my API key was blocked. I solved the problem by generating a new one but it took me hours to figure out what the problem was. 
Another problem I faced was that I didnt know how to use to_numpy and specify the columns that I wanted to obtain information from. I went around it and found another method. Which taught me that the same result could be obtained in a different way.
